## Handling Circular Dependencies with Webpack Dynamic Imports

### 1. Webpack Dynamic Imports for Modular Architecture

- **Dynamic Imports**: We leverage Webpack’s **dynamic import** functionality to delay the loading of circularly dependent components (`Button` and `List`), breaking the direct re-render loop.
- Instead of importing `List` and `Button` immediately, we dynamically load them inside the `useEffect` hook using **`import('@components/List')`** and **`import('@components/Button')`**, which returns promises. This allows asynchronous handling of the imports.

### 2. Why Dynamic Imports Work

- **Lazy Loading on Demand**: By delaying the import of dependent components until runtime, we avoid immediate circular re-renders. The components are only loaded when needed, preventing the infinite re-render loop.
- **No Conditional Rendering**: We avoid state-based toggles like `showButton` and `showList`, relying instead on Webpack’s dynamic imports and React’s lifecycle to handle the asynchronous component loading.
- **Webpack Module Caching**: Once Webpack loads a module, it caches it. This ensures that dynamically loaded components are only imported once, preventing repeated circular execution and re-renders.

### 3. When Webpack Is Not Enough

- **Complex Logic Issues**: While Webpack’s dynamic imports help manage module loading and execution order, circular dependencies may still cause issues with React’s re-render cycle. In such cases, Webpack alone isn’t enough to resolve re-renders, and additional React strategies like **memoization** and **lazy loading** are required for highly interactive components.
- **State-Based Re-renders**: If components re-render based on state or props, Webpack can’t control this behavior. React's built-in rendering controls are needed to handle these re-renders.

### 4. Implementation of Dynamic Loading

- In both `Button` and `List`, we use functions like `loadList` for `List` and `loadButton` for `Button` to dynamically import the other component.
- Once the component is loaded, we store it in a state variable (e.g., `ListComponent` in `Button`).

```javascript
const loadList = async () => {
  const { default: ListComponent } = await import("@components/List");
  setListComponent(() => ListComponent);
};
```
