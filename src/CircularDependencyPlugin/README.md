## Circular Dependency Management

### 1. Circular Dependency Detection with Webpack Plugin

- Integrated **`circular-dependency-plugin`** into the Webpack build process to detect circular dependencies during build time.
- The build will fail if a circular dependency is detected, ensuring issues are addressed before deployment.
- This helps maintain a clean and maintainable codebase free from circular dependency problems.

### 2. Webpack Aliases for Module Resolution

- Webpack aliases are used to simplify imports and prevent circular dependencies.
- Aliases are configured for key directories (e.g., `Components`, `Utils`) to reduce the complexity of deep relative imports.
- This improves code organization and makes it easier to avoid circular references.

### 3. Lazy Loading and Conditional Rendering

- **Lazy loading** with `React.lazy` is employed to defer the rendering of components until needed, which helps break circular dependency chains.
- **Conditional rendering** is used to control when components are rendered, further preventing circular rendering loops.
- These techniques ensure that circular dependencies do not lead to runtime issues like infinite loops.

### 4. Best Practices

- Keep components and utility functions modular and decoupled to reduce the risk of circular dependencies.
- Leverage **Webpack aliases** and **lazy loading** as core strategies to mitigate circular dependencies in React applications.
